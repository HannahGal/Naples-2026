<div class="intro">
  <p>We're off to one of Italy’s most vibrant and authentic cities.<br>
  Guaranteed to be full of fun, with good food, plenty of alcohol, gelato, mixed with a bit of history, a bit of rain, and best of all, we'll be making memories ❤️</p>
  <p>We are staying in the heart of Naples’ historic centre on Via San Gregorio Armeno — an atmospheric street famous for its artisan shops and traditional nativity makers. Steps away from the heart of the city with narrow streets lined with pizzerias, cafés, cosy bars, restaurants and historic sights.</p>
  <p><strong>Scroll down for more info…</strong></p>
  <p>I hope you enjoy ☺️</p>

    <h3>20 Fascinating Facts about Pompeii</h3>
    <div class="fact"><p><strong>1.</strong> Pompeii was frozen in time – The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD preserved the city almost exactly as it was on an ordinary day.</p></div>
    <div class="fact"><p><strong>2.</strong> Ash preserved everyday life – Food, furniture, graffiti, and even garden layouts survived under layers of volcanic ash.</p></div>
    <div class="fact"><p><strong>3.</strong> People were preserved as casts – Archaeologists poured plaster into voids left by decomposed bodies, creating haunting human shapes.</p></div>
    <div class="fact"><p><strong>4.</strong> Pompeii wasn’t fully rediscovered until 1748 – It lay buried for nearly 1,700 years.</p></div>
    <div class="fact"><p><strong>5.</strong> The eruption lasted about 24 hours – Not a single explosion, but waves of ash, pumice, and deadly gas.</p></div>
    <div class="fact"><p><strong>6.</strong> Pompeii had fast food – Thermopolia (street food counters) sold hot meals, similar to modern takeaways.</p></div>
    <div class="fact"><p><strong>7.</strong> Graffiti covered the walls – Political slogans, insults, love notes, jokes, and ads are still readable today.</p></div>
    <div class="fact"><p><strong>8.</strong> It had advanced plumbing – Public fountains, lead pipes, and indoor toilets were common.</p></div>
    <div class="fact"><p><strong>9.</strong> Pompeii had traffic rules – Raised stepping stones let pedestrians cross streets while carts passed through gaps.</p></div>
    <div class="fact"><p><strong>10.</strong> Dogs were memorialized – One famous plaster cast shows a dog still chained, frozen mid-struggle.</p></div>
    <div class="fact"><p><strong>11.</strong> The city was wealthy – Luxurious villas, mosaics, and imported goods show Pompeii was prosperous, not poor.</p></div>
    <div class="fact"><p><strong>12.</strong> Erotic art was everywhere – Explicit frescoes and symbols were normal, not taboo, in Roman culture.</p></div>
    <div class="fact"><p><strong>13.</strong> Pompeii had a thriving nightlife – Taverns, bars, brothels, and theaters were common.</p></div>
    <div class="fact"><p><strong>14.</strong> Earthquakes warned them – A major quake in 62 AD damaged the city, but many residents stayed.</p></div>
    <div class="fact"><p><strong>15.</strong> Pompeii had an amphitheatre before the Colosseum – Built in 70 BC, it’s one of the oldest stone amphitheatres in the world.</p></div>
    <div class="fact"><p><strong>16.</strong> Some victims survived initially – Many died hours later from toxic gas, not lava.</p></div>
    <div class="fact"><p><strong>17.</strong> Loaves of bread were found intact – Carbonized but recognizably baked, complete with baker’s stamps.</p></div>
    <div class="fact"><p><strong>18.</strong> Not everyone died – Thousands escaped before the worst phase of the eruption.</p></div>
    <div class="fact"><p><strong>19.</strong> Excavations are still ongoing – New rooms, inscriptions, and skeletons are still being discovered today.</p></div>
    <div class="fact"><p><strong>20.</strong> Pompeii changed archaeology forever – It gave historians an unmatched snapshot of ordinary Roman life.</p></div>
